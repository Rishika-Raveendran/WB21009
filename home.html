                                Museums are an essential tool for preserving and restoring our rich cultural and artistic past. The legacies of a given era - artwork, paintings, sculptures and even entire cultures can be preserved in a museum. This preservation is significant to ensure
                                that upcoming generations are rooted in their history to learn and grow from their ancestral past. The Museums in Trivandrum hope to achieve something on similar lines - to preserve the cultural and heritage past of the
                                state of Kerala and city Trivandrum for its growing population.
